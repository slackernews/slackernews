# Demo Prereqs

SlackerNews is fully self-hosted and it integrates with a few different
systems. Therefore we provide a demo mode that does not require any
connectivity to Slack, your internal systems, or any other services.

This is useful for experimenting with the SlackerNews installation process and
learning about the application. It has very limited functionality and very
minimal prerequisites.

1. A community license (registry username & password) to SlackerNews. Visit
   [SlackerNews.io](https://slackernews.io) to get a free license.
2. Access to a Kubernetes cluster (1.23 or later) or Linux Virtual Machine
   with a minimum of 4GB RAM and 50GB of disk space.

## Next steps

If you meet these prerequisites you should proceed with the
[installation](/supported-installations).
