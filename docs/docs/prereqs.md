# Prereqs

SlackerNews is fully self-hosted and it integrates with a few different
systems. Therefore the requirements are a bit technical.

1. A community license (registry username & password) to SlackerNews. Visit
   [SlackerNews.io](https://slackernews.io) to get a free license.
2. A domain or subdomain & the ability to control DNS for it.
3. Admin rights on your Slack Workspace (or approval from an admin).
4. Access to a Kubernetes cluster (1.23 or later)
5. Read level access to most of your companies primary tools (GitHub, Google
   Docs, Jira etc).

## Next steps

If you meet these prerequisites you should proceed with [domain setup](/domain).
