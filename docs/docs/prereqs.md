# Prereqs
SlackerNews is fully self-hosted and it integrates with a few different systems. Therefore the requirements are a bit technical.

1. A community license to SlackerNews. Visit [SlackerNews.io](https://slackernews.io) to get a free license.
2. A domain or subdomain & the ability to control DNS for it.
3. Admin rights on your Slack Workspace (or approval from an admin).
4. Access to a Kubernetes cluster (1.23 or later) OR access to a modern Linux VM with at least 4 cores and 16gb RAM.
5. Read level access to most of your companies primary tools (GitHub, Google Docs, Jira etc).

If you meet these prerequisites you should proceed with the [custom domain](/domain).
